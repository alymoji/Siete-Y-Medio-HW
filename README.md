PIC 10C HW 1

I had multiple issues when committing new ideas to my project. Where this project starts is where I left off when the last time the program deleted all my work. This is the third attempt as the first one had a completed code but when I checked out the file, the new work was auto deleted. 

I believe that this attempt may work and I did learn a lot from my mistakes.
